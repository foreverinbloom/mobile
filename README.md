# Rooted in the Word 🌱

**Rooted in the Word** is a simple, recall-first Scripture memory tool designed for congregational use at MBC.

This tool emphasizes *speaking Scripture out loud*, gradual recall, and reflection on God’s character — not scoring, checking, or performance.

It is intentionally lightweight, mobile-friendly, and forgiving for users who are new to Scripture memory or inconsistent in practice.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

Scripture memory here is about:
- **Retrieval, not testing**
- **Formation, not performance**
- **Cultivation, not completion**

The design encourages users to *recite first*, then reveal Scripture gradually through typed initials. There is no grading or correction — only reinforcement.

The 🌱 symbol reflects this posture: *rooted, growing, and still becoming*.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Paste the Verse
Paste a verse into the **Verse source** box.

The tool automatically:
- Uses quoted text when present
- Removes:
  - URLs
  - verse references (e.g. “Psalm 84:1”)
  - translation labels (ESV, NIV, etc.)
  - footnote markers from Bible sites (a, b, c, etc.)
- Keeps only the Scripture text needed to generate initials

The verse source can be hidden once practice begins.

### 2. Say It Out Loud 🗣️
When ready:
- Tap **Show**
- Recite the verse out loud
- Type the **initials of each word** as you speak

As correct initials are typed:
- Words are revealed gradually
- The verse appears as recall progresses

This mirrors how memory actually forms: *speech → recall → reinforcement*.

---

### 3. Practice Controls

- **Clear initials**  
  Clears typed letters and resets the reveal **without hiding practice**

- **Reset**  
  Hides practice and returns to a “start fresh” state

- **Clear (Verse source)**  
  Clears the pasted verse and resets the entire session

---

### 4. Reflection Prompt ✦
Each day, a rotating reflection prompt appears, focused on **God’s character**, not personal application.

Examples:
- *What does this reveal about God’s character?*
- *How is Christ reflected or anticipated here?*
- *What does this verse deny about God?*

Prompts rotate daily using the calendar date to encourage slow, repeated meditation.
